# Coderive

A mobile-first general programming language written primarily in Java 7. The runtime is built in c. It is a dual parser (antlr + manual "recursive backtracking"), dual compilation language (bytecode + native code generation).

## Vision
To have the very first filipino-made mobile-first production-ready self-hosting (native) programming language.

## Mission  
To have a programming language as a general use and solve any issues with the currently existing ones.

## Core Values
- Clean code structure
- Fast compilation and runtime
- Mobile-first development

## Development Environment
The developer (DanexCodr) is constrained by only having a phone:

1. **Java NIDE** - Fast Java 7 compiler
2. **Quickedit** - Fast editor  
3. **Termux** - Comprehensive linux environment
4. **AI Assistants** - Deepseek and Gemini for faster code debugging

## Technical Architecture
- Custom AOT compiler with JIT techniques
- "Future-cost â€” predict next use register spilling" register allocation
- Dual compilation pipeline (bytecode + native)
- Multi-target code generation (ARM64/x86_64)

## Language Example
```coderive
unit demo.program get {
    cdrv.Math
}

share interactiveDemo {
    ~| formula, operation
    local calculate(int a, int b, string op) {
        if op == "+" {
            ~ formula a + b
            ~ operation "addition"
        } else if op == "-" {
            ~ formula a - b
            ~ operation "subtraction"
        }
        // ... more code
    }
    
    share main() {
        output "=== CODERIVE INTERACTIVE DEMO ==="
        demonstrateArrays()
        getUserInfo()
        interactiveCalculator()
        numberSeries()
        edgeCaseLoops()
    }
}
```

## Compilation Output

```
[20:26:28.018] [INFO] RUNNER: Starting MTOT compilation pipeline
[20:26:28.021] [INFO] RUNNER: Input file: interactiveDemo.cdrv
[20:26:28.056] [INFO] RUNNER: AST built successfully
[20:26:28.068] [INFO] BYTECODE: Compilation complete: 1076 instructions across 9 methods
[20:26:28.071] [INFO] MTOT: Detected CPU: aarch64

```

## Generated Assembly Sample

```assembly
    .text
    .global add
add:
    stp x29, x30, [sp, #-16]!
    mov x29, sp
    sub sp, sp, #48
    // Saving callee-saved registers
    stp x19, x20, [x29, #-16]
    // ... ARM64 assembly code
    mov x0, x23
    ret
```

## Runtime Performance

The system demonstrates working register allocation and proper loop execution across both interpreter and native compilation targets, with the native code showing expected output for complex loop patterns and edge cases.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Run interpreter
java -jar coderive.jar program.cdrv

# Compile to native
java -jar coderive.jar --native program.cdrv
```

## Notable Features

### **Language Innovations**
- **Multi-return slots** with slot declarations atop function definitions
- **Expressive smart for-loops** with complex step patterns (`by *2`, `by i+=1`, `by *+2`)
- **Implicit class and method declaration** for reduced boilerplate
- **Cleaner importing system** with modular unit support

### **Technical Breakthroughs**  
- **Mobile-first compiler architecture** - built entirely on Android devices
- **Hybrid "future-cost" register allocation** with predictive spilling
- **Dual-parser system** (ANTLR + recursive backtracking) for robust parsing
- **Multi-target native compilation** from single Java codebase (ARM64/x86_64)

## ðŸš€ Novel Contributions

- **First production-ready compiler designed and built entirely on mobile devices**
- **Proving serious systems programming can happen outside traditional environments** 
- **AI-paired mobile development methodology** using DeepSeek/Gemini as coding partners
- **Filipino-led compiler innovation** challenging Western-dominated language development
- **Constraint-driven architecture** turning mobile limitations into strengths
